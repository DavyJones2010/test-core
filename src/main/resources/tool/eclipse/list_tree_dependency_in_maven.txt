// why am I excluding slf4j-log4j12 from spring batch?
log4j-over-slf4j.jar and slf4j-log4j12.jar cannot be present simultaneously: 
The presence of slf4j-log4j12.jar, that is the log4j binding for SLF4J, will force all SLF4J calls to be delegated to log4j.
The presence of log4j-over-slf4j.jar will in turn delegate all log4j API calls to their SLF4J equivalents.
If both are present simultaneously, slf4j calls will be delegated to log4j, and log4j calls redirected to SLF4j, resulting in an endless loop.
