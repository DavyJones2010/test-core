Session Bean: Represents the business logic. It may be stateless, stateful or singleton.	
1. Types of Session Bean:
	1) Stateless Session Bean: It doesn't maintain state of a client between multiple method calls.
	2) Stateful Session Bean: It maintains state of a client across multiple requests.
	3) Singleton Session Bean: One instance per application, it is shared between clients and supports concurrent access.

2. Stateless Session Bean:
	1) Conversational state between multiple method calls is not maintained by the container in case of stateless session bea.
	2) The stateless bean objects are pooled by EJB container to service the request on demand.
	3) It can be accessed by one client at a time. In case of concurrent access, EJB container routes each request to different instance.

3. Stateful Session Bean:
	1) 	Conversational state between multiple method calls is maintained by the container in stateful session bean.
